_A newb who's recently interested in the glorious world of Big Data & coding. I heard GitHub is one of the best places to jot-down codes ..._
_And so, here I am_ ðŸ’ƒâœ¨
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning **SQL**
- ðŸ‘€ Interested in **Data Science**


Having worked in different industries, pulling and analysing different kinds of data- This quote from Ronald van Loon rings very true ðŸ’¯  
> Data and data science greatly influence everything we doâ€¦The impact that data has and will haveâ€¦continues to grow every day.


Other fav' quotes:
From Jon Acuff - Explains the models that we built today or in the past, finding connections between them allows us to predict future events/outcomes to better prepare ourselves. 
> Thatâ€™s all data is. A gift from yesterday that you receive today to make tomorrow better


From Vik Paruchuri (Founder of Dataquest) - Highlights the tumultuous journey of a Data Scientist and in order to succeed by having a combo of high motivation levels, clear objectives, and help from an excellent mentor.
> Nobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. ... Without motivation, youâ€™ll stop halfway through and believe you canâ€™t do it when the fault isnâ€™t with youâ€•itâ€™s with the teaching. Take control of your learning by tailoring it to what you want to do, not the other way around.
